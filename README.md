FiveM Racing Chaos Mod Script


This is the first FiveM Script I co-made with my friend! There may be a few issues, so please let me know if you notice any. Since I'm new to this and I'm still learning the coding language LUA, please be kind :) 

Issues I'm aware of and am trying to fix: (Or I don't know how to fix)

Bayblade Spinout is not being smooth. - I have no Idea How to fix!

This Script is Open Source, so please feel free to edit it as you like! My Discord is Willp#4981, so if you have any improvements, I'll be glad to upload and make them available for other people.


How to Install


1: Download the [Latest Release](https://github.com/WillpOnGitHub/fivem-chaosmod/releases/) 
2: Extract the file
3: Put the fivemchaosmod file into your server's resource folder
4: Put: Ensure fivemchaosmod into your server.cfg file
5: When in-game put in the console: chaos_toggle
6: To disable it do the same command again!

FYI: Doing this command does it for all FiveM instances that are logged into your server!

There you have it, a Racing Chaos Mod in FiveM!
